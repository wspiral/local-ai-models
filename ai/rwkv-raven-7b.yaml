description: |
    RWKV is an RNN with Transformer-level LLM performance, which can also be directly trained like a GPT transformer (parallelizable).
    And it's 100% attention-free. You only need the hidden state at position t to compute the state at position t+1. 
    You can use the "GPT" mode to quickly compute the hidden state for the "RNN" mode.
    This version is quantized for ggml to work with rwkv.cpp.
